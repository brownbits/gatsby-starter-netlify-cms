  title: Who are you?
  description: >
    What makes you uniquely you?  


    Perhaps it’s your identity: name, ethnicity, citizenship, political affiliation, religion.  



    Perhaps it’s your genes. Or how you look?  


    Perhaps it’s how you feel.  



    You may be pretty sure of who you are.


    But maybe sometimes, with some people, in some situations, you are not so sure.


    The answer to the question of “who we are” is not as simple as it may seem at first blush. But few of us spend much time digging deeper. We simply assume an identity— derived from where we find ourselves, where we live, whom we associate with. Then we go on auto-pilot, rarely diving below the surface of our existence. Until something blows us off course and we become unmoored— unknown, even to ourselves.


    Wouldn’t it be better to explore the landscape of our lives before we are lost. Seek self-knowledge, examine our deepest impulses, our values, our reasons for being? Wouldn’t it be preferable to take that understanding and live a more deliberate life— to happen to the world, before it happened to us?


    That was the thinking that led us to develop this program of self-inquiry, which draws on our own investigations over 20 years, including through readings, discussions, insights and experimentation on how to live a meaningful life. We took a practical, critical and evidence-based approach that builds on the thinking of leading scientists and philosophers.


    Instead of prescribing one perfect way to be, our program guides you on a path that illuminates different perspectives, habits of mind and concepts to help you create your own reasons, and discover your own answers to the questions of who you are, what matters to you and how to live a life that is meaningful to you.

  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

        There is no shortage of advice on how to live your best life, how to
        lead, how to work well with others, or how to become a world-class
        organization— whatever that means. We’re not here to peddle yet another
        theory or even to give you answers. Instead, we focus on showing you
        different ways of looking at yourself and the world around you, to
        decide— as we say— how to “happen to the world.”


        Using a multi-disciplinary, evidence-based approach you will learn to think critically, differently and creatively about decisions / choices, priorities, leadership, collaboration, achievement, well-being and many other aspects of your personal and professional life.


        To help you arrive at your own answers, we offer a flexible program that can be delivered through one-on-one coaching, keynote speeches, board/management retreats, conference sessions or practically any other format.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
